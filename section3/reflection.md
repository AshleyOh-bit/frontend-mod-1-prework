## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

 I was most intrigued by the S. M. A. R. T. approach. I appreciate that it is measured, forward thinking, and definite; a cornerstone to come back to in times of doubt. I see how it is relevant to coding, but intend to apply it to other aspects of my life.

The Zone of Proximal Development was initially intimidating. Reading further, I realized it's a more precise way of say "stuff I already know." I like thinking of my ZPD as an ever-changing landscape, increasing in size, developing detail, and saturating with color as I learn. I hope when I'm 80, I have a ZPD the size of Texas!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I already believe that consistent practice and diligence will greatly improve my learning, and I definitely tackle/seek challenges with a methodical approach. Since the readings in Mod 0, I'm trying to improve my fluency in the pursuit of true understanding, and am attempting this with small bits of daily practice. I think it's working?

I need to grow in understanding that mistakes and struggle are the fertilizer of the learning tree. I also struggle with learning when/how to ask for help. It's taking some effort to override some of the shame ingrained with these things, and rewrite them to be opportunities for growth. I also need to focus on process a bit more; I catch myself looking ahead/planning beyond my present and occasionally miss out because of that.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

On Pinterest, I believe my boards are examples of arrays, and each board comprises a flexible number of pins (elements?). Though I am the one manipulating the locations of the images/links that are stored in these arrays, they are also bits of data contained within the larger app and accessible to other users.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a built-in Javascript function that specifically manipulates an array. An array method could  effect the number of elements in an array, their indexes, or their contents, among other things. Examples of array methods are: .pop(), .shift(), and .push().

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is a way to iterate. It checks a condition, evaluates whether it is true or false, and executes the prescribed code until the condition evaluates to false. It's specifically useful for automating tasks and relieving the programmer and computer from unnecessary repetition.

It is best to use a loop in conjunction with an array when we need to evaluate/manipulate each element of an array. It is the most efficient way to access each element in an array because loops are counters that can incrementally access elements.  

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is a counter. We make rules to tell the counter when to start counting, when to stop counting, and how to count. Sometimes when it counts, it does another task at the same time.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Honestly, I'm struggling with describing loops (as evidenced above), and specifically need more practice with using for loops with arrays. I'm curious about how loops coincide with if statements and functions, and though we practiced the former, I have no idea how to format the latter.

On another note related to my Pinterest mention above: are the pins in Pinterest objects? Can there be an array of objects? Or are they primitive data types, and each image is a string?
